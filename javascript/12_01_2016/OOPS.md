OOPS - OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING STRUCTURE

There are so many data types we saw in JS and one of the special one is the object.
Objects also gives us the power to write our own structured variable/datatype

    var x = {
        firstName: 'Srikar',
        callback: function(){
            return 'Shastry';
        },
        rollNumber: 55
    };
    
    
    
JSON - JAVA SCRIPT OBJECT NOTATION
These are very lightweight objects that can be shared between one machine to another.


CLASS
Objects have fixed properties and fixed values when we define them. So, when we want to construct a dynamically changing object,
we end up using functions.

Classes are nothing but functions that are converted to objects.
